  <h1> Canary Islands </h1>
  <p>
    The Canary Islands, a volcanic archipelago off the coast of northwestern Africa, are among Spainâ€™s farthest-flung territories. These rugged islands are known for their black- and white-sand beaches, varied resorts and balmy climate. Tenerife, the largest island, is dominated by the sometimes-snowy peaks of volcanic Mt. Teide, part of a national park with its own astronomical observatory.
