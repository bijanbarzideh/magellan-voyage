  <h1> Cape Verde</h1>
  <p>
Cape Verde, or Cabo Verde, is a nation on a volcanic archipelago off the northwest coast of Africa. Itâ€™s known for its Creole Portuguese-African culture and morna music. Its many beaches are jumping-off points for windsports and diving among shipwrecks. Its largest island, Santiago, is home to the current capital, Praia, and the old capital, Cidade Velha, with its clifftop fortress.
