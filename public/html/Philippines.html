  <h1> Philippines </h1>
  <p>
The Philippines is a Southeast Asian country in the Western Pacific, comprising more than 7,000 islands. Its sprawling capital, Manila, is famous for its waterfront promenade and centuries-old Chinatown. Intramuros, a walled city in colonial times, is the heart of Old Manila. Itâ€™s home to the baroque 16th-century San Agustin Church as well as Fort Santiago, a storied citadel and military prison.
